<BR><H3>May it be better to make the program keep notes in one file?</H3></P>

<P>Keeping notes in a tree - the main feature, for which the program was developed. This does not mean that someday I will not add the option for choosing ways of storing your notes, but this will not happen in the near future.</P>

<BR><H3>Will there be a visual editor for the pages?</H3></P>

<P>There are some thoughts to make a separate page type format RichTextFormat with the visual editor. Please do not exclude the possibility that there will be a visual editor for HTML-pages. But still I can't talk about dates.</P>
